Contingencies might include the buyer selling their home, receiving mortgage approval, or reaching an agreement with the seller on the home inspection.                                      |\n",
      "|Active under contract         |A house is listed as “active under contract” when the seller has accepted an offer with contingencies, but still wants the house to be listed as active. In this situation, the seller is also likely accepting backup offers in case their current offer fails to meet its contingencies.                                                              |\n",

      "|Adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)|The interest rate for an adjustable-rate mortgage changes periodically. You might start with lower monthly payments than you would with a fixed-rate mortgage, but fluctuating interest rates will likely make those monthly payments rise in the future.                                                                                               |\n",

      "|Amortization                  |Amortization is the schedule of your mortgage payments spread out over time. In real estate, a buyer's amortization schedule is usually one monthly payment scheduled over a 15- or 30-year period of time.                                                                                                                                             |\n",

When buying a home, the lender requires an appraisal by a third party (the appraiser) to make sure the loan amount requested is accurate. If the home’s appraised value is below what the buyer has offered, the lender may request the buyer pay the difference in cost.|\n",
